# Journal avaible for translation
This is the Journal theme for Ghost CMS, made availble for translation. It only contains one French json file but now all you have to do is customizing it to your needs and with your required language. 
# How to translate
In order to make your own translation of Journal, download the file of this fork and create a new file named with your langauge's abreviation and ".json" extension, just like that <abreviation>.json. In the example of french, you'll find a file named "fr.json". Beware, using fr.json as a translation file for another language will result in displaying your translation only when your website's settings are defining french as main language. You need to properly name your file according to the language you use.

When your JSON file is created, you need to fill it with your translation. In order to do that, you can copy the french translation's content andreplace french bits with yours. Do not touch the english bits ! This will prevent Ghost from using your bits and force it to fall back onto the original language of the theme (which is english).
